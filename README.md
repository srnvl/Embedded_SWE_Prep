I am not the creator of this list of problems but I am surely the creator of this repo :) . Credits to the original creator(s):

I am also linking the problems from Grind75(https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?order=difficulty&grouping=topics&hours=40&weeks=3&difficulty=Easy&difficulty=Medium)

Note: The filter of the website is set to Easy and Medium problems (143 problems in all from this website itself)
