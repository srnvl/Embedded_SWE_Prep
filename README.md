List of questions(I am not the creator of this list. Credits to the original creator(s)!):

Linked list
-----------------
Determine if there is a cycle or not
If there is a cycle, return the node where the cycle begins
Find the node where two linked lists intersect
Remove Nth node from end of the list
Reverse linked list
Remove linked list elements of a given value
Group all odd nodes and even nodes together in order
Palindrome linked list
Merge two sorted linked lists
Insert into a cyclic sorted linked list

XOR linked list
Reverse linked list in blocks of K

Arrays
-----------
Find pivot index (where sum of numbers to left = sum of numbers to right)
Diagonal traverse and print
Spiral matrix

Two pointer technique - reverse string, array partition
Two pointer - one fast runner, one slow runner - remove element in one scan, max consecutive 1's, minimum size subareay sum, rotate array
Reverse words in a string - word by word, reverse within a word and maintain the order
Remove duplicates from sorted array
Move all zeroes to the end
Max sub array sum - DP

Bit Manipulation
--------------------------
Swap bits in odd and even positions
Power of 2
Set, clear and toggle i'th bit
Find position of the only bit that is set
